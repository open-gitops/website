It is an evolution of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and a DevOps best practice that leverages Git as the single source of truth, and control mechanism for creating, updating, and deleting IT system infrastructure. Implementing and using GitOps based strategy changes the way of securing the overall IT systems. Proper implementation of GitOps strategy increases the security and reliability itself but still leaves several attack vectors open. Traditional processes mostly rely on human operational knowledge, expertise and actions performed manually but in case of GitOps all changes are made as interactions with Git repository.\\nGitOps allows to separate deployments from development and use full advantage of the immutable declarative infrastructure. Every element of the environment can be deployed as often as needed with the same result, instances are redeployed instead of restoring from multiple unique configurations and versions. Immutability of infrastructure protects from making changes from outside of the main deployment process and makes it easier to detect and reverse environment changes based on the declarative state in the Git repository.\\nOne of the other key benefits of GitOps could be more than just how to make the deployment of the infrastructure and software faster, but could also improve MTTR - Mean Time To Remediate/Repair. MTTR is an essential failure metric that represents the average time it takes to repair and restore a component or system to function. GitOps is also helpful in the case of the disaster recovery plan, rollback, and reversing changes.\"), mdx(\"h2\", {\n    \"id\": \"securing-gitops-repository-and-process\"\n  }, \"Securing GitOps Repository and Process\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"GitOps provides:\"), mdx(\"ul\", null, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"a SINGLE source of truth for the state of a given environment,\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"a SINGLE process to introduce changes,\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"a SINGLE source of truth to run security scans against intended state, allowing for best practices to be enforced before they reach the target environments,\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"a SINGLE source of truth to run security scans against previous states to identify when a security issue was introduced (i.e. git bisect),\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"a SINGLE set of tests, \"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"a SINGLE set of permissions and implement necessary controls and gates on this process to make sure that you can meet security requirements. \"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"ability to eliminate the need to make manual changes on environments.\\nThe centralized management process provides easy access to audit trail: what was changed, who and why made changes.

It should be restricted who can make changes in process itself including the principle of least privilege as well as the separation of duties. It should be avoided to use administration permissions. GitOps process should be hardened and protected from elevating permissions to remove security features without leaving an audit trail and triggering alerts.
