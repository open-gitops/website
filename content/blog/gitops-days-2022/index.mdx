### What is GitOps Days?

Last month [GitOps Days](https://www.gitopsdays.com/) took place on June 8th and 9th. Hosted by [Weaveworks](weave.works) and jam-packed with informative and educational sessions from speakers on varying levels of the cloud native spectrum. These speakers ranged from GitOps end-user practitioners at various stages of their GitOps journeys to integrators offering ways of extending and enhancing Kubernetes and GitOps, to vendors offering GitOps to their Enterprise Customers. The goal of the event is to evangelize GitOps as a de-facto cloud native operating model, practice and methodology, as well as help individuals and organizations get started wherever they are on their cloud native journey.

If you missed the live event, no worries - you can still get the on-demand livestream video links by signing up at [gitopsdays.com](https://www.gitopsdays.com/), or checkout the individual sessions on the [GitOps Days 2022 Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9lTuCFNLaD0NVkR17tno4X6BkxsbZZfr).


### Keynotes

The event kicked off with a Keynote from [Taylor Dolezal](twitter.com/onlydole), Head of Ecosystem at the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](cncf.io) who spoke about the [CNCF ecosystem, GitOps’ journey as a natural evolutions of Kubernetes](https://youtu.be/CfOMGK_YZGQ), and how you can get involved (spoiler alert: join the [GitOps Working Group](https://github.com/cncf/tag-app-delivery/tree/main/gitops-wg)). 

Up next was [Philippe Ensarguet](https://twitter.com/P_Ensarguet), CTO at [Orange Business Services](https://twitter.com/orangebusiness) with [GitOps is the way to overcome the scaling wall for enterprise organizations](https://youtu.be/lKI7juzYgMo). He shared his learnings from consulting with other CTOs and the heads of technology from Orange’s customers and partners, some cloud native trends, and Orange’s GitOps journey.

In her keynote talk, [GitOps’ Wealth of Opportunity](https://youtu.be/QoVShNwMJiQ), [Mae Large](http://twitter.com/MayLarge), Staff Field Engineer at VMware, who has been a GitOps practitioner since 2019, shares benefits realized through Gitops from both the practice itself and a practitioner’s career. Mae also shares GitOps architectures and adoption approaches which she has been involved with.

And the last, but certainly not the least, of the keynotes was [GitOps Business Benefits at State Farm](https://youtu.be/swfLyou3Ggo) from Rayce Brossette. Rayce spoke about the benefits of managing scale, money and time savings, as well as security from adopting GitOps with Flux at State Farm.

### Platform Vendors & Cloud Providers Offering GitOps with Flux

If you’re a practitioner or customer looking to move forward with GitOps, check out these talks from cloud providers and platform vendors who are offering GitOps to their customers (most trust Flux as their solution under the hood)!



* [Weave GitOps & Scaling Teams – James Wilson (Weaveworks)](https://youtu.be/5b91fhbLcE0) Weave GitOps is a suite of tools, powered by and extending Flux, focused on application lifecycle management and application delivery. James gives an overview and then shows the power of Weave GitOps with a demo!
* [GitOps in Microsoft Azure with Flux – Chris Sanders & Jonathan Innis (Microsoft)](https://youtu.be/60jhYD2wLkY) To provide Kubernetes admins and app developers with the latest tooling for managing configuration and application deployment, Azure enables GitOps with Flux. In this session, we will live demo how CNCF Flux is enabled in Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes and Azure Kubernetes Services and how management of GitOps-enabled clusters in Azure can be achieved at scale.
* [GitOps with Amazon EKS Anywhere – Chandler Hoisington & Joey Wang (AWS)](https://youtu.be/99nVJbILhLY) Amazon EKS Anywhere helps you create and manage Kubernetes clusters in a declarative way with the help of GitOps.
