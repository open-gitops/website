The GitOps Working Group is a WG under the CNCF App Delivery TAG.

The focus of the GitOps WG is to clearly define a vendor-neutral, principle-led meaning of GitOps. This will establish a foundation for interoperability between tools, conformance, and certification. Lasting programs, documents, and code are planned to live within the [OpenGitOps](https://github.com/open-gitops) project.

See the [charter](https://github.com/gitops-working-group/gitops-working-group/blob/main/charter.md) for additional info on the group's mission, scope, and alignment with other groups and projects.

## Growing Adoption of GitOps

The creation of the GitOps Working Group was driven by the accelerating adoption of GitOps tools and methodologies by users of services from Amazon, Codefresh, GitHub, Microsoft, Weaveworks, and hundreds of other leading global companies that are adopting GitOps.
This, combined with the recommendation by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) [user community to adopt Flux](https://radar.cncf.io/2020-06-continuous-delivery), made it clear that GitOps is fast becoming the methodology of choice for operating modern cloud native infrastructure and applications.
The CNCF user community reported that development, DevOps, and operations teams who adopt GitOps tooling and follow best practices experience improvements in productivity, stability, reliability, and security for their cloud native environments.

## The What and Why of GitOps

If you are new to GitOps, [it builds and iterates](https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-operations-by-pull-request) on ideas drawn from DevOps and Infrastructure as Code that started with [Martin Fowlerâ€™s comprehensive Continuous Integration overview](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html) and provides the freedom to choose the tools that you need for your specific use cases.

Individuals, teams, and organizations who implement GitOps experience many benefits, including:

- Increased Developer & Operational Productivity
- Enhanced Developer Experience
- Improved Stability
- Higher Reliability
- Consistency and Standardization
- Stronger Security Guarantees
