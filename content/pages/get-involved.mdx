There are a few ways you can get involved:

- Start a [Discussion](https://github.com/open-gitops/project/discussions)
- [Open an issue](https://github.com/open-gitops/project/issues) and let us know how you're using GitOps and any important considerations we should include
- Join `#wg-gitops` on [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/)
- Join the [SIG App Delivery](https://github.com/cncf/sig-app-delivery) mailing list, and watch or participate in topics prefixed with `[gitops-wg]`
- See [Working Group project boards](https://github.com/orgs/gitops-working-group/projects) for status of work, or for ideas on areas that could use additional participation
